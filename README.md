# AGCOD Client

The client will print all parts of the request when making the request.

Run the client with `python3 client.py`.

If you only wish to prepare the request and print the request that is being sent,
but not send it, comment line 311 in client.py and uncomment line 314.

If you want to use a fixed date time string for debugging, comment line 58 in client.py,
and uncomment line 59 in client.py.
